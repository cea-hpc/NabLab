## Introduction

NabLab is a full-fledged industrial environment for scientific computing and High Performance Computing based on [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/).

This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v. 2.0 which is available at https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v20.html.

Please refer to the license for details.

## Getting started

The latest NabLab environment can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/cea-hpc/NabLab/releases/tag/v0.3.3). For Mac users, depending on your security configuration, you have to enter the following command to execute NabLab: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine NabLab.app`.

Once the NabLab environment has been launched, the NabLab perspective should be selected. If it is not the case, just select the NabLab perspective from the *Window > Perspective > Open Perspective > Other ... > NabLab* menu.

<img src="./README_images/NabLab_perspective_menu.png" alt="NabLab Perspective Menu" title="NabLab Perspective Menu" width="30%" height="30%" />

The NabLab perspective provides a set of *Views* and wizards shortcuts allowing to easily create and develop nabla models.

### Create a new project

From the *Model Explorer View* in the *NabLab* perspective, just right-click and select *New > Nabla Project* to create a new project:

<img src="./README_images/NabLab_new_menu.png" alt="NabLab New Project" title="NabLab New Project" width="60%" height="60%" />

You can also create it from the *File > New > Nabla Project* main menu.

A new wizard is launched, asking for a project name and a module name:

<img src="./README_images/NabLab_new_project_wizard.png" alt="NabLab New Project Wizard" title="NabLab New Project Wizard" width="50%" height="50%" />

Just click on the *Finish* button to create the new project. The new project is available in the *Model Explorer View*:

<img src="./README_images/NabLab_new_project_result.png" alt="NabLab New Project Result" title="NabLab New Project Result" width="30%" height="30%" />

It contains two models (*MyModule.nabla*, and *MyModule.nablagen*) in the *nabla.project/src/mymodule/* folder.

To launch the java and kokkos source code generations corresponding to the nabla module, just right-click on the *nabla.project/src/mymodule/MyModule.nablagen* and select *Run As > Launch Generation*

<img src="./README_images/NabLab_nablagen_launch_generation.png" alt="NabLab Launch Generation" title="NabLab Launch Generation" width="50%" height="50%" />

The java and kokkos source code files are generated in *src-gen-java* and *src-gen-cpp* folders respectively.

### Examples project

From the *Model Explorer View* in the *NabLab* perspective, just right-click and select *New > Nabla Examples* to import the examples project:

<img src="./README_images/NabLab_new_menu.png" alt="NabLab Examples" title="NabLab Examples" width="60%" height="60%" />

You can also import it from the *File > New > Nabla Examples* main menu.

A new wizard is launched:

<img src="./README_images/NabLab_nabla_examples_wizard.png" alt="NabLab Examples Wizard" title="NabLab Examples Wizard" width="50%" height="50%" />

Just click on the *Finish* button to import the examples project. The examples project is available in the *Model Explorer View*:

<img src="./README_images/NabLab_nabla_examples_generated_files.png" alt="NabLab Examples Generated Files" title="NabLab Examples Generated Files" width="100%" height="100%" />

It contains a set of Nabla examples including Glace2D, HeatEquation, ImplicitHeatEquation, and ExplicitHeatEquation.

### Latex View

The *Latex View* is located on the bottom right corner of the NabLab environment. It allows to visualize in an elegant way the nabla formulas contained in a *nabla* model.

The *Latex View* is accessible through the *Window > Show View > Other... > Nabla > Latex View* main menu.

This view is automatically updated and synchronized with the selection in the current nabla model editor.

### Job Graph Editor

The *Job Graph Editor* can be opened from a *nablagen* model, by clicking on F2.

It allows to visualize the graph of jobs computed from the *nablagen* model.

## Build via Maven 3.x

To build the NabLab products for Windows/Linux/MacOS and the Eclipse update-site, you can run the following command from the root of the repository:
`mvn clean; mvn verify`.

Note the `';'` after `mvn clean`. 

The products resulting from the build will be accessible in */releng/fr.cea.nabla.updatesite/target/products/NabLab-1.0.0.yyyymmddHHMM-YOUR_PLATFORM.zip*.

The Eclipse update-site resulting from the build will be accessible in */releng/fr.cea.nabla.updatesite/target/fr.cea.nabla.updatesite-1.0.0.yyyymmddHHMM.zip*.

Just install this update-site in an Eclipse 2020-03 with Sirius 6.4.0 and Xtext 2.21.0 already installed to use NabLab.

If you want to skip tests execution, you can run the following command:
`mvn clean; mvn verify -Dmaven.test.skip=true`

## Dependencies

NabLab requires Java 11 or later to build & run.
