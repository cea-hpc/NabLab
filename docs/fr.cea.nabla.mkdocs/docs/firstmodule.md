# My first module

## Presentation of the problem

The aim of this tutorial is to implement a simple equation of diffusion in NabLab on a 2D cartesian mesh:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
\partial_t u - div(K \nabla u) &= f \text{ in } \Omega \\
(K \nabla u)n &= g \text{ on } \partial \Omega
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$

In this tutorial the equation is discretized with a finite volume scheme on a 2D cartesian mesh.
A constant approximation of u by cell gives:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{u_M^{n+1} - u_M^n}{\Delta t} &= f_M + \frac{1}{V_M}\int_{M}{div(K \nabla u^n)} \\
&= f_M + \frac{1}{V_M}\int_{\partial M}{(K \nabla u^n) . \nu} \\
&= f_M + \frac{1}{V_M}\sum_{M' \text{neighbor of } M}{K_{MM'} \frac{u_{M'}^n - u_{M}^n}{MM'}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

where $u_M$ is the temperature of the cell M, $f_M$ is the source term of the cell M, $\nu$ is the face normal vector and $K_{MM'}$ the value of $K$ on $M \cap  M'$.

Consequently:
 
$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
u_M^{n+1} &= \Delta t f_M + u_M^n + \frac{\Delta t}{V_M} \sum_{M' \text{ neighbor of } M}{K_{MM'} \frac{u_{M'}^n - u_{M}^n}{MM'}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

## Implementing the module

The module must be implemented in the *HeatEquation.n* file. Edit it by double-clicking on the file name in the explorer.

A full description of the language is available in the [reference documentation](../nablablanguage). 


### Imports

The module starts with the import of the extensions: Math and CartesianMesh2D.

Extension files describe services implemented in external libraries called providers. For more details see the extension section in the [reference documentation](../nablablanguage).
The NabLab product includes three extensions, CartesianMash2D, Math and LinearAlgebra, and their implementations in Java and C++.

[Math](https://github.com/cea-hpc/NabLab/blob/master/plugins/fr.cea.nabla/nablalib/Math.n) contains the ∑, ∏, Min and Max reductions and the usual mathematical functions (sin, cos, √...).

[CartesianMesh2D](https://github.com/cea-hpc/NabLab/tree/master/plugins/fr.cea.nabla/nablalib/CartesianMesh2D.n) contains a 2D cartesian mesh extension as well as the corresponding Java and C++ [providers](https://github.com/cea-hpc/NabLab/tree/master/plugins/fr.cea.nabla/nablalib/CartesianMesh2D.ngen).

```
module HeatEquation;

with Math.*;
with CartesianMesh2D.*;
```

### Options

The next part of the file relates to the definition of options: variables whose value can be set in the user data file. Two kinds of options are defined, simulation and user options:

```
// Simulation options
option ℝ stopTime = 0.1;
option ℕ maxIterations = 500;

// User options
option ℝ PI = 3.1415926;
option ℝ α = 1.0;
```

Simulation options represents the maximum time and number of iterations of the simulation. We will see below how they will define the conditions of the iteration loop. 


### Variables

For the heat equation module, the variables are:

- *δt* and *t* representing respectively the time step and time of the simulation. Time step is initialized with a default value. It will be constant during the simulation,
- *X* and center representing respectively coordinates of nodes and center of cells,
- *u*, *V* and *f* representing the cells' variables presented in the above equation,
- *outgoingFlux* representing the $\frac{\Delta t}{V_M} \sum{K_{MM'} \frac{u_{M'}^n - u_{M}^n}{MM'}}$ part of the equation,
- *surface* representing the surface of faces.

```
let ℝ δt = 0.001;
ℝ t;
ℝ[2] X{nodes}, center{cells};
ℝ u{cells}, V{cells}, f{cells}, outgoingFlux{cells}, surface{faces};
```

### Time iterators

The next part of the file defines the time loop iterators, a single one named *n* for this example, and the stop condition of the time loop.

```
iterate n while (t^{n} < stopTime && n < maxIterations);
```

### Jobs

The next part of the file is dedicated to definition of jobs.

The order of jobs in the editor does not matter for execution. NabLab will build the data flow graph of jobs to determine their execution rank.

At first, four jobs for initializing the values of *t*, *f*, *center* and *u* variables are defined. Fell free to change the initialization of $u^{n}_{j}$!

```
IniTime: t^{n=0} = 0.0;
IniF: ∀j∈cells(), f{j} = 0.0;
IniCenter: ∀j∈cells(), center{j} = 0.25 * ∑{r∈nodesOfCell(j)}(X{r});
IniUn: ∀j∈cells(), u^{n}{j} = cos(2 * PI * α * center{j}[0]);
```

To compute the center of cells, we use the $\sum$ reduction defined in the *Math* extension of the NabLab language. Thus, the following instruction must be added at the beginning of the file after the module definition: 

```
with Math.*;
```

Then two jobs are needed to compute the volume and surface of cells:

```
ComputeV: ∀j∈cells(), V{j} = 0.5 * ∑{r∈nodesOfCell(j)}(det(X{r}, X{r+1}));
ComputeSurface: ∀f∈faces(), surface{f} = 0.5 * ∑{r∈nodesOfFace(f)}(norm(X{r}-X{r+1}));
```

The `det` and `norm` functions are also defined in the *Math* library. To see the full content of the library, press `F3` on one of its functions, for example `det`. It will open the *Math.n* provided by NabLab.

Now, it is time to code the above formula. It can be done in a single job but we have divided it into two parts: the compute of the outgoing flux representing the $\frac{\Delta t}{V_M} \sum{K_{MM'} \frac{u_{M'}^n - u_{M}^n}{MM'}}$ part of the equation and the compute of the $u^{n+1}$ value:

```
ComputeOutgoingFlux: ∀j1∈cells(), outgoingFlux{j1} = δt/V{j1} * ∑{j2∈neighbourCells(j1)}(∑{cf∈commonFace(j1,j2)}( (u^{n}{j2}-u^{n}{j1}) / norm(center{j2}-center{j1}) * surface{cf}));
ComputeUn: ∀j∈cells(), u^{n+1}{j} = f{j} * δt + u^{n}{j} + outgoingFlux{j};
```

In the *ComputeOutgoingFlux* job, the face is accessed through a $\sum$. In NabLab, all connectivities are handled in the same way even if they return a singleton like the *commonFace* connectivity which returns a single face.

The LaTeX view below the editor displays the job content equation and facilitates the verification of its correctness. Just place your cursor on the job of your choice in the editor to see the LaTeX view changed. 

<img src="img/NabLab_compute_un_latex.png" alt="NabLab LaTeX view" title="NabLab LaTeX view" width="80%" height="80%" />

Finally, just update the global time in a last job.

```
ComputeTn: t^{n+1} = t^{n} + δt;
```

The algorithm representing the problem to solve is now complete. the last task consists in defining the global application.


## Defining the application

The application must be defined in the *HeatEquation.ngen* file. Edit it by double-clicking on the file name in the explorer.

!!! note
	The *ngen* file already exists in the project: it has been created by the wizard. If you need to create this *ngen* file on an existing project, NabLab provides a code generator for that: right-click on the *HeatEquation.n* file and select the *Generate nablagen file* menu. 

A full description of the language is available in the [reference documentation](../ngenlanguage). 

### Global parameters

The application must identify its main module which will control the simulation time loop. 

Some parameters have to be fixed like the mesh class name and the variables representing the node coordinates, the time and time step of the simulation and the maximum time and time step of the simulation. 

!!! note
	All keywords and references to NabLab variables are available by contextual code completion with `CTRL-Space` keys.
 

```
MainModule HeatEquation heatEquation
{
	nodeCoord = X;
	time = t;
	timeStep = δt;
	iterationMax = maxIterations;
	timeMax = stopTime;
}
```

### VTK output

NabLab provides a [PVD](https://vtk.org/Wiki/ParaView/Data_formats#PVD_File_Format) file format serializer, a [VTK](https://vtk.org/) compatible file format. To configure  this serializer add the block below. 

```
VtkOutput
{
	periodReferenceVariable = heatEquation.n;
	outputVariables = heatEquation.u as "Temperature";
}
```

The `periodReferenceVariable` field defines the module variable used as a reference for the frequency of the outputs, here the iteration number `n`. The `outputVariables` field defines the list of nodes and cells variables to write in the output file. The name after the `as` keyword is the name displayed by [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/).

The `outputPath` and `outputPeriod` can be set in the *json* data file.


### Generation target

To configure generation, create a generation block, for example for the `StlThread` target.

!!! note
	Other generation target are available by code completion with `CTRL-Space` key or in the [ngen reference documentation](../ngenlanguage/#configuring-generation).

```
StlThread
{
	outputPath = "/Tutorial/src-gen-cpp/stl-thread";
	CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER = "/usr/bin/g++";
}
```

For C++ targets, provide the path to the desired compiler into the `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` variable.


## Jobs sequence

NabLab computes the data flow of the application to define the job execution rank. To see the computed graph of jobs, display the *HeatEquation.ngen* file in the editor and press the `F2` key.

<img src="img/NabLab_heatequation_job_graph.png" alt="NabLab Job Graph" title="NabLab Job Graph" width="80%" height="80%" />

To see jobs composing the time loop, double-click on *HeatEquation::ExecuteTimeLoopN* job. Input and output variables of a job are displayed in puttingthe mouse over a job.
 
<img src="img/NabLab_heatequation_time_loop_job_graph.png" alt="NabLab Time Loop Job Graph" title="NabLab Time Loop Job Graph" width="80%" height="80%" />

!!! note
	A quick representation of the graph is available in the *Job Graph View* tab under the editor by pressing the `F1` key (instead of `F2` for the complete editor).


## Generation

To launch code generation, just right-click on the *HeatEquation.ngen* file and select *Generate Code*

<img src="img/NabLab_generate_code.png" alt="NabLab Generate Code" title="NabLab Generate Code" width="50%" height="50%" />

C++ source code files *HeatEquation.h* and *HeatEquation.cc* are generated in the *src-gen-cpp/stl-thread* folder. A *CMakeLists.txt* file is also generated to compile the application. A LaTeX file containing the content of the jobs and an example of json data file are also generated in the *src-gen* folder. The list of generated files are displayed in the NabLab console.

<img src="img/NabLab_generation_msg.png" alt="NabLab Generation Messages" title="NabLab Generation Messages" width="80%" height="80%" />

!!! note
	A good practice is to name *src-gen* a directory containing only generated code.


## Compilation


To build the application, go into the generation directory containing the *CMakeLists.txt* generated file i. e. `/Tutorial/src-gen-cpp/stl-thread/heatequation` and enter the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
After the compilation of the application, a *heatequation* executable is available in the *build* directory.


## Execution

To execute the application, a data file is needed. NabLab generates a template named *HeatEquationDefault.json* in the *src-gen* directory. Copy this file, paste it in the *src* directory, rename it *HeatEquation.json* (select the file in the explorer and press `F2` key) and double-click on it in the explorer to open the json editor.

Remove the comment line, the file is no more generated, and add a mesh block as follows:

```json
{
	"heatEquation":
	{
		"_outputPath_comment":"empty outputPath to disable output",
		"outputPath":"output",
		"outputPeriod":1,
		"stopTime":0.1,
		"maxIterations":500,
		"PI":3.1415926,
		"alpha":1.0
	},
	"mesh":
	{
		"nbXQuads":20,
		"nbYQuads":20,
		"xSize":0.1,
		"ySize":0.1
	}
}
```

The application can then be executed. In the *build* directory, enter the following command:
 
```
./heatequation ../../../../src/heatequation/HeatEquation.json
```

## Vizualizing results

The `outputPeriod` value is set two *1* in the *HeatEquation.json* and the `outputPath` value is *output*. Consequently, an output directory has been created and it contains a VTP file for each time step and a PVD file named *HeatEquation.pvd". The results can be visualize in Paraview with the following command:

```
paraview output/HeatEquation.pvd
```
