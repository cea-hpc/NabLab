Presentation of the project NabLab is a open-source research project led by HPC initiative of the CEA . It aims is to provide a productive development way for exascale HPC technologies, flexible enough to be competitive in terms of performances. It is composed of: a numerical analysis Domain Specific Language (DSL) to improve applied mathematicians productivity throughput and enables new algorithmic developments for the construction of hierarchical and composable high-performance scientific applications. an full-fledged environment to edit, interpret, debug specific numerical-analysis sources and to generate optimized code for various C++ targets. Motivation Addressing the major challenges of software productivity and performance portability is becoming necessary to take advantage of emerging extreme-scale computing architectures. As software development costs will continuously increase to address exascale hardware issues, higher-level programming abstraction will facilitate the path to go. There is a growing demand for new programming environments in order to improve scientific productivity, to facilitate the design and implementation, and to optimize large production codes. How it works NabLab is based on Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) . The NabLab DSL is realized with Xtext that allows to offer a rich textual editor with syntax coloring, code completion, quick fixes... The DSL raises the level of abstraction close to domain scientist concerns and allows them to write multi-physics applications. The code in the editor has an internal EMF model representation. This representation, close to the language, is transformed into a numerical analysis specific Intermediate Representation (IR) also implemented as an Ecore metamodel. The transformation chain, based on the IR model, allows HPC engineers to introduce software engineering practices and performance optimization before the code generation.

This tutorial covers the default one. Presentation of the problem Let us imagine the NabLab Swan module simulating the effects of the propagation of seismic waves on sea surface. To wave height variable H and the depth sea variable D need to be initialized thanks to the following InitH and InitD jobs: // wave initialization InitH: \u2200ic\u2208innerCells(), H{ic} = nextWaveHeight(); // depth initialization InitD: if (DConst) \u2200ic\u2208innerCells(), D{ic} = Dini; else \u2200ic\u2208innerCells(), D{ic} = nextDepth(); The nextWaveHeight and nextDepth functions have to access shared scientific data provided by NetCDF in a C language library. The aim of this tutorial is to see how to create the NabLab extension containing the functions and how to implement and package a NabLab extension provider associated to this extension. Creating the project We will create a NabLab extension called BathyLib . The best practice consists in creating an independent project for the extension and its providers. To do that, just click on the main menu File > New > NabLab Project to create a new project: A new wizard is launched, asking for a project name and an extension name: Enter BathyLib as project name, select the Extension radio button and enter BathyLib as extension name and click on the Finish button to create the new project. The new project is available in the Model Explorer on the left of the window. It contains two files ( BathyLib.n , and BathyLib.ngen ) in the Tutorial/src/bathylib/ folder: Note The extension can also be created into the same project as the application, into a separate folder. However, if you plan to share the extension between projects, creating a project for the extension remains the best solution. Defining the extension Double-click on the src/bathylib/BathyLib.n file to open it and declare the nextWaveHeight and nextDepth functions in the NabLab editor like this: extension BathyLib; def nextWaveHeight: \u2192 \u211d; def nextDepth: \u2192 \u211d; The Swan module containing the InitH and InitD jobs need to import the extension. At first the swan project must add the BathyLib project to its dependencies: double-click on the /swan/META-INF/MANIFEST.mf file in the explorer on the left of the window, select the Dependencies tab and click on Add... button in the middle of the panel. In the dialog box, select the BathyLib project and click on the Add button. The swan project depends now on the BathyLib one. Finally, import the BathyLib extension in the Swan.n file to use the BathyLib functions into the Swan module: module Swan; with BathyLib.*; It is noteworthy that the above functions have no body. We will see now how to create the C++ methods providing the glue code to call the NetCDF C functions. Declaring a provider The role of providers is to implement extensions. It is possible to implement several providers for an extension, for example a Java one and a C++ one. In this tutorial we will implement only one C++ provider for the BathyLib extension. The first step to define the provider is to create a ngen file containing the provider definition. Note The ngen file already exists in the project: it has been created by the wizard. If you need to create this ngen file on an existing project, NabLab provides a code generator for that: right-click on the BathyLib.n file and select the Generate nablagen file menu. Double-click on the BathyLib.ngen file to open the editor and suppress lines to let only a simple C++ provider as follows: Provider BathyLibCpp : BathyLib { target = StlThread; outputPath = \"/BathyLib/src-cpp/stl-thread\"; } The above example defines a provider named BathyLibCpp that implements BathyLib . This provider will be generated for the StlThread target in the provided outputPath . More information on generation targets are available in the Ngen language reference . Note The implemented extension and the available targets are available by contextual code completion with CTRL-Space keys. The output folder name is src-cpp rather than src-gen-cpp because the content of the folder is not totally generated: it will be filled by the user in the following section. Implementing the provider The aim of the previously defined provider is to implement the nextWaveHeight and nextDepth BathyLib functions. These functions have to be implemented as methods of a C++ class called BathyLibCpp , the name of the provider. To assist the provider implementation, NabLab offers a code generator. Right-click on the BathyLib.ngen file and select the Generate Code menu. Generated files can be observed in the outputPath folder, in our example \"/BathyLib/src-cpp/stl-thread\". The CMakeLists.txt file is full generated and contains recipes to build the library. The IBathyLib.h file contains the interface representing the BathyLib extension. This file is 100% generated: do not edit this file as it is written in the header comment. This file contains the C++ StlThread generator implementation of the NabLab BathyLib extension and a jsonInit method. Note Template functions can not be defined abstract in the interface. Consequently, if the extension implementation generates template functions, they appear as comment in the interface for information. Extension implementation The BathyLib.h and BathyLib.cc files define the C++ class implementing the BathyLib extension represented by the IBathyLib C++ interface. The body of their methods is empty and has to be implemented. In our example the methods will contain glue code in charge of calling the NetCDF functions. The BathyLib.h and BathyLib.cc files can be edited, they will not be overwritten: they are only generated if they do not already exist. If the extension changes, the generation of the provider will change the interface but not the implementation class (never overwritten). Consequently the implemented code will not compile. In this case, copy the signature of the interface's functions and paste them into the implementation class. This model follows the Generation Gap Pattern . Provider initialization using Json NabLab creates providers by calling the default constructor (with no argument). The jsonInit method allows to initialize the provider class if needed. When you implement a provider extension, you are free to inject the Json content you wish. At the beginning of the execution, when the Json data file is read, NabLab will look for Json fields corresponding to extension names with the first letter in lower case; in the above example, bathyLib . This file must be in the block of the module (or extension) using the extension; in the above example in the swan block. { \"swan\" : { \"_outputPath_comment\" : \"empty outputPath to disable output\" , \"outputPath\" : \"output\" , \"outputPeriod\" : 10 , \"maxIter\" : 2500000 , \"stopTime\" : 50.0 , \"bathyLib\" : { \"waveFilename\" : \"$ENV{HOME}/workspaces/swan/swan/data/swan/waveCanal.grd\" , \"waveVarName\" : \"z\" } }, \"mesh\" : { \"nbXQuads\" : 1103 , \"nbYQuads\" : 44 , \"xSize\" : 200.0 , \"ySize\" : 200.0 } } The Json block corresponding to an extension is injected as an argument to the jsonInit method of the extension. In the previous example, the value of the bathyLib field, becomes the value of the jsonContent argument in BathyLib::jsonInit(const char* jsonContent) method. This value is: { \"waveFilename\" : \"$ENV{HOME}/workspaces/swan/swan/data/swan/waveCanal.grd\" , \"waveVarName\" : \"z\" } Configuring dependencies The CMakeLists.txt file generated with the provider is designed to be included in the CMakeLists.txt of the module using the extension, not to be called directly. It is totally generated and is overwritten during each generation: do not edit this file. Nevertheless, the provider sometimes need to add dependencies to external libraries. Fortunately, all NabLab generated CMakeLists.txt files allow to include the content of a Project.cmake file: # OPTIONAL USER OPTIONS IN Project.cmake if (EXISTS ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/Project.cmake) include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/Project.cmake) endif() The previously defined BathyLibCpp provider depends on NetCDF library. Thus, this dependency has to appear in a Project.cmake file like this: target_link_libraries(bathylibcpp PUBLIC netcdf) Application generation Extension and provider association So, now what do we have to do to inject the provider in an application that imports the extension? Most of the time, nothing! If the target of generation of the application (defined in the ngen file) matches the provider's target or one of its compatible targets (also defined in the ngen file) the matching between extension and provider is automatic. In the example, the Swan application has a unique StlThread generation target and it corresponds to the target field of the BathyLibCpp provider. During the generation of the Swan application, the NabLab console displays a message showing the default match: If several providers are included in the ngen file, the generation process will take the first one which matches the target conditions. To bypass this mechanism, the matching between extension and provider can be explicitly defined in the ngen file of an application for each generation target after the outputPath field. For the Swan application, this is done with the following instruction: StlThread { outputPath = \"/swan/src-gen-cpp/stl-thread\"; extension BathyLib providedBy BathyLibCpp; CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER = \"/usr/bin/g++\"; } Once again, the code completion (with CTRL-Space key) proposes the list of extension and the list of providers implementing the extension. Building the application The application can be built as usual: go into the generation directory containing the CMakeLists.txt file (in our example /swan/src-gen-cpp/stl-thread/swan ) and enter the following commands: mkdir build cd build cmake .. cmake --build . All the linked libraries will be built in the build directory, including those of the providers. Application interpretation The interpreter operates as the generator to look for a provider matching an extension. The interpreter is written in Java and look for Java providers. Most of the time NabLab users only need C++ code generation and they implement C++ providers. Fortunately, NabLab provides a JNI generation mechanism to call C++ providers from the interpreter (or from a Java application). To trigger the JNI code generation, configure the interpreter target in the ngen file with the desired provider. In our Swan example, the ngen file has to define the following interpreter target: Interpreter { outputPath = \"/swan/src-gen-interpreter\"; extension BathyLib providedBy BathyLibCpp; CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER = \"/usr/bin/g++\"; JAVA_HOME = \"/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64\"; } The interpreter block can provide the path to the desired compiler into the CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER variable and needs to set the JAVA_HOME variable to allow the JNI compilation. To get the JNI code for the interpreter, launch the generation as usual: right-click on the ngen file (in the example Swan.ngen ) and select Generate Code . The NabLab console displays information showing the JNI generation: The generation produces a folder for each JNI provider (name of the provider + jni) and a folder corresponding to the application. In our example, it corresponds to a bathylibcppjni folder for the bathylibcpp provider and a swan folder for the application. To build the generated code, just go into the folder application, /swan/src-gen-interpreter/swan in our example, and build the code as usual: mkdir build cd build cmake .. cmake --build . The interpretation needs an additional installation step to provide libraries to the interpreter in: make install . Finally the interpretation process can be triggered as usual: right-click on the ngen file, select Run As > Start Interpretation . Note Do not forget that the JNI generation process is not necessary if your application does not use extension or if you already have a Java provider. In this case, interpretation can be done directly.","title":"My first extension"},{"location":"firstextension/#my-first-extension","text":"Note NabLab defines three kinds of extension: default, linear algebra and mesh.

In our Swan example, the ngen file has to define the following interpreter target: Interpreter { outputPath = \"/swan/src-gen-interpreter\"; extension BathyLib providedBy BathyLibCpp; CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER = \"/usr/bin/g++\"; JAVA_HOME = \"/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64\"; } The interpreter block can provide the path to the desired compiler into the CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER variable and needs to set the JAVA_HOME variable to allow the JNI compilation. To get the JNI code for the interpreter, launch the generation as usual: right-click on the ngen file (in the example Swan.ngen ) and select Generate Code . The NabLab console displays information showing the JNI generation: The generation produces a folder for each JNI provider (name of the provider + jni) and a folder corresponding to the application. In our example, it corresponds to a bathylibcppjni folder for the bathylibcpp provider and a swan folder for the application. To build the generated code, just go into the folder application, /swan/src-gen-interpreter/swan in our example, and build the code as usual: mkdir build cd build cmake .. cmake --build . The interpretation needs an additional installation step to provide libraries to the interpreter in: make install . Finally the interpretation process can be triggered as usual: right-click on the ngen file, select Run As > Start Interpretation . Note Do not forget that the JNI generation process is not necessary if your application does not use extension or if you already have a Java provider. In this case, interpretation can be done directly.","title":"Application interpretation"},{"location":"firstmodule/","text":"My first module Presentation of the problem The aim of this tutorial is to implement a simple equation of diffusion in NabLab on a 2D cartesian mesh: \\[ \\begin{equation} \\begin{cases} \\partial_t u - div(K \\nabla u) &= f \\text{ in } \\Omega \\\\ (K \\nabla u)n &= g \\text{ on } \\partial \\Omega \\end{cases} \\end{equation} \\] In this tutorial the equation is discretized with a finite volume scheme on a 2D cartesian mesh.

The new project is available in the Model Explorer on the left of the window. It contains two files ( HeatEquation.n , and HeatEquation.ngen ) in the Tutorial/src/heatequation/ folder: Implementing the module The module must be implemented in the HeatEquation.n file. Edit it by double-clicking on the file name in the explorer. A full description of the language is available in the reference documentation . Imports The module starts with the import of the extensions: Math and CartesianMesh2D. Extension files describe services implemented in external libraries called providers. For more details see the extension section in the reference documentation . The NabLab product includes three extensions, CartesianMash2D, Math and LinearAlgebra, and their implementations in Java and C++. Math contains the \u2211, \u220f, Min and Max reductions and the usual mathematical functions (sin, cos, \u221a...). CartesianMesh2D contains a 2D cartesian mesh extension as well as the corresponding Java and C++ providers . module HeatEquation; with Math.*; with CartesianMesh2D.*; Options The next part of the file relates to the definition of options: variables whose value can be set in the user data file. Two kinds of options are defined, simulation and user options: // Simulation options option \u211d stopTime = 0.1; option \u2115 maxIterations = 500; // User options option \u211d PI = 3.1415926; option \u211d \u03b1 = 1.0; Simulation options represents the maximum time and number of iterations of the simulation. We will see below how they will define the conditions of the iteration loop. Variables For the heat equation module, the variables are: \u03b4t and t representing respectively the time step and time of the simulation. Time step is initialized with a default value. It will be constant during the simulation, X and center representing respectively coordinates of nodes and center of cells, u , V and f representing the cells' variables presented in the above equation, outgoingFlux representing the \\(\\frac{\\Delta t}{V_M} \\sum{K_{MM'} \\frac{u_{M'}^n - u_{M}^n}{MM'}}\\) part of the equation, surface representing the surface of faces. let \u211d \u03b4t = 0.001; \u211d t; \u211d[2] X{nodes}, center{cells}; \u211d u{cells}, V{cells}, f{cells}, outgoingFlux{cells}, surface{faces}; Time iterators The next part of the file defines the time loop iterators, a single one named n for this example, and the stop condition of the time loop. iterate n while (t^{n} < stopTime && n < maxIterations); Jobs The next part of the file is dedicated to definition of jobs. The order of jobs in the editor does not matter for execution. NabLab will build the data flow graph of jobs to determine their execution rank. At first, four jobs for initializing the values of t , f , center and u variables are defined. Fell free to change the initialization of \\(u^{n}_{j}\\) ! IniTime: t^{n=0} = 0.0; IniF: \u2200j\u2208cells(), f{j} = 0.0; IniCenter: \u2200j\u2208cells(), center{j} = 0.25 * \u2211{r\u2208nodesOfCell(j)}(X{r}); IniUn: \u2200j\u2208cells(), u^{n}{j} = cos(2 * PI * \u03b1 * center{j}[0]); To compute the center of cells, we use the \\(\\sum\\) reduction defined in the Math extension of the NabLab language. Thus, the following instruction must be added at the beginning of the file after the module definition: with Math.*; Then two jobs are needed to compute the volume and surface of cells: ComputeV: \u2200j\u2208cells(), V{j} = 0.5 * \u2211{r\u2208nodesOfCell(j)}(det(X{r}, X{r+1})); ComputeSurface: \u2200f\u2208faces(), surface{f} = 0.5 * \u2211{r\u2208nodesOfFace(f)}(norm(X{r}-X{r+1})); The det and norm functions are also defined in the Math library. To see the full content of the library, press F3 on one of its functions, for example det . It will open the Math.n provided by NabLab. Now, it is time to code the above formula. It can be done in a single job but we have divided it into two parts: the compute of the outgoing flux representing the \\(\\frac{\\Delta t}{V_M} \\sum{K_{MM'} \\frac{u_{M'}^n - u_{M}^n}{MM'}}\\) part of the equation and the compute of the \\(u^{n+1}\\) value: ComputeOutgoingFlux: \u2200j1\u2208cells(), outgoingFlux{j1} = \u03b4t/V{j1} * \u2211{j2\u2208neighbourCells(j1)}(\u2211{cf\u2208commonFace(j1,j2)}( (u^{n}{j2}-u^{n}{j1}) / norm(center{j2}-center{j1}) * surface{cf})); ComputeUn: \u2200j\u2208cells(), u^{n+1}{j} = f{j} * \u03b4t + u^{n}{j} + outgoingFlux{j}; In the ComputeOutgoingFlux job, the face is accessed through a \\(\\sum\\) . In NabLab, all connectivities are handled in the same way even if they return a singleton like the commonFace connectivity which returns a single face. The LaTeX view below the editor displays the job content equation and facilitates the verification of its correctness. Just place your cursor on the job of your choice in the editor to see the LaTeX view changed. Finally, just update the global time in a last job. ComputeTn: t^{n+1} = t^{n} + \u03b4t; The algorithm representing the problem to solve is now complete. the last task consists in defining the global application. Defining the application The application must be defined in the HeatEquation.ngen file. Edit it by double-clicking on the file name in the explorer. Note The ngen file already exists in the project: it has been created by the wizard. If you need to create this ngen file on an existing project, NabLab provides a code generator for that: right-click on the HeatEquation.n file and select the Generate nablagen file menu. A full description of the language is available in the reference documentation . Global parameters The application must identify its main module which will control the simulation time loop. Some parameters have to be fixed like the mesh class name and the variables representing the node coordinates, the time and time step of the simulation and the maximum time and time step of the simulation. Note All keywords and references to NabLab variables are available by contextual code completion with CTRL-Space keys. MainModule HeatEquation heatEquation { nodeCoord = X; time = t; timeStep = \u03b4t; iterationMax = maxIterations; timeMax = stopTime; } VTK output NabLab provides a PVD file format serializer, a VTK compatible file format. To configure this serializer add the block below. VtkOutput { periodReferenceVariable = heatEquation.n; outputVariables = heatEquation.u as \"Temperature\"; } The periodReferenceVariable field defines the module variable used as a reference for the frequency of the outputs, here the iteration number n . The outputVariables field defines the list of nodes and cells variables to write in the output file. The name after the as keyword is the name displayed by Paraview . The outputPath and outputPeriod can be set in the json data file. Generation target To configure generation, create a generation block, for example for the StlThread target. Note Other generation target are available by code completion with CTRL-Space key or in the ngen reference documentation . StlThread { outputPath = \"/Tutorial/src-gen-cpp/stl-thread\"; CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER = \"/usr/bin/g++\"; } For C++ targets, provide the path to the desired compiler into the CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER variable. Jobs sequence NabLab computes the data flow of the application to define the job execution rank. To see the computed graph of jobs, display the HeatEquation.ngen file in the editor and press the F2 key. To see jobs composing the time loop, double-click on HeatEquation::ExecuteTimeLoopN job. Input and output variables of a job are displayed in puttingthe mouse over a job. Note A quick representation of the graph is available in the Job Graph View tab under the editor by pressing the F1 key (instead of F2 for the complete editor). Generation To launch code generation, just right-click on the HeatEquation.ngen file and select Generate Code C++ source code files HeatEquation.h and HeatEquation.cc are generated in the src-gen-cpp/stl-thread folder. A CMakeLists.txt file is also generated to compile the application. A LaTeX file containing the content of the jobs and an example of json data file are also generated in the src-gen folder. The list of generated files are displayed in the NabLab console. Note A good practice is to name src-gen a directory containing only generated code. Compilation To build the application, go into the generation directory containing the CMakeLists.txt generated file i. e. /Tutorial/src-gen-cpp/stl-thread/heatequation and enter the following commands: mkdir build cd build cmake .. cmake --build . After the compilation of the application, a heatequation executable is available in the build directory. Execution To execute the application, a data file is needed. NabLab generates a template named HeatEquationDefault.json in the src-gen directory. Copy this file, paste it in the src directory, rename it HeatEquation.json (select the file in the explorer and press F2 key) and double-click on it in the explorer to open the json editor. Remove the comment line, the file is no more generated, and add a mesh block as follows: { \"heatEquation\" : { \"_outputPath_comment\" : \"empty outputPath to disable output\" , \"outputPath\" : \"output\" , \"outputPeriod\" : 1 , \"stopTime\" : 0.1 , \"maxIterations\" : 500 , \"PI\" : 3.1415926 , \"alpha\" : 1.0 }, \"mesh\" : { \"nbXQuads\" : 20 , \"nbYQuads\" : 20 , \"xSize\" : 0.1 , \"ySize\" : 0.1 } } The application can then be executed. In the build directory, enter the following command: ./heatequation ../../../../src/heatequation/HeatEquation.json Vizualizing results The outputPeriod value is set two 1 in the HeatEquation.json and the outputPath value is output . Consequently, an output directory has been created and it contains a VTP file for each time step and a PVD file named *HeatEquation.pvd\". The results can be visualize in Paraview with the following command: paraview output/HeatEquation.pvd","title":"My first module"},{"location":"firstmodule/#my-first-module","text":"","title":"My first module"},{"location":"firstmodule/#presentation-of-the-problem","text":"The aim of this tutorial is to implement a simple equation of diffusion in NabLab on a 2D cartesian mesh: \\[ \\begin{equation} \\begin{cases} \\partial_t u - div(K \\nabla u) &= f \\text{ in } \\Omega \\\\ (K \\nabla u)n &= g \\text{ on } \\partial \\Omega \\end{cases} \\end{equation} \\] In this tutorial the equation is discretized with a finite volume scheme on a 2D cartesian mesh.

The central part of the NabLab environment displays a textual editor, based on Xtext which provides contextual code completion, code folding, syntax highlighting, error detection, quick fixes, variable scoping, and type checking. The left part of the environment proposes a model explorer and a dedicated interactive outline view to navigate easily through the textual editor. The bottom part is composed of several views including a rich LaTeX visualization of the selection in the editor. A graphical editor based on Sirius allows to visualize the data flow graph between jobs. Perspective Once the NabLab environment has been launched, the NabLab perspective should be selected. If it is not the case, just select the NabLab perspective from the Window > Perspective > Open Perspective > Other ... > NabLab menu. The NabLab perspective provides a set of Views and wizards shortcuts allowing to easily create and develop NabLab projects.

Interpretation To launch code interpretation corresponding to the NabLab module, just right-click on the ngen file of the project of your choice, for example NabLabExamples/src/explicitheatequation/ExplicitHeatEquation.ngen and select Run As > Start Interpretation . To change the json file of your interpretation, right-click on the ngen file and select Run As > Run Configurations , select your configuration, for example ExplicitHeatEquation.ngen , and change the json file in the dialog window. Note If you have installed and configured GraalVM for NabLab, you can interpret your module using GraalVM: just select Run As > Start Truffle-Based Interpretation instead of Run As > Start Interpretation . You can set configuration like previously and set the monilog file and python executable path. LaTeX view The LaTeX View is located on the bottom of the NabLab environment. It allows to visualize in an elegant way the formulas contained in a .n file. If you do not use the NabLab perspective the The LaTeX View is not visible. You can access it through the Window > Show View > Other... > NabLab > LaTeX View main menu. This view is automatically updated and synchronized with the selection in the current NabLab editor. Job graph NabLab offers 2 visualization modes for job graph: a fast rendering view and an editor with a more efficient layout. In case of job cycles, both of the modes will display the cycle graphically to highlight the error. Note In both visualization modes, let the mouse over a job node to display its input and output variables. View The Job Graph View can be opened from a ngen file containing an Application , by clicking on F1. It allows to quickly visualize the data flow graph of the application described in the ngen file.

Module module Glace2d; A module represents a NabLab program and its definition strictly follows the following sequence: Imports Reductions Functions Variables and options Time iterators Jobs A module is generally associated with a NabLab application . Several modules can also be composed into a single application: see module composition documentation. Extension extension Math; An extension is a way to extend the language with external functions. Its definition strictly follows the following sequence: Imports Reductions Functions Functions of an extension can be called from a NabLab module. To use an extension X, a module has to import the extension with the instruction with X.*; (see below). Extensions provide external functions, i.e. functions with no NabLab body. Those functions are implemented in an another language, generally C or C++. To link NabLab function declaration to its native definition, providers have to be defined: see NabLab extension providers for details. The extension and extension provider mechanisms are the way to call legacy libraries from NabLab applications. Note NabLab library provides a mathematical extension containing the \u2211, \u220f, Min and Max reductions and the usual mathematical functions (sin, cos, \u221a...). Linear algebra extension linearalgebra extension LinearAlgebra; A linear algebra extension is an extension with no reductions, only functions. Moreover, functions' arguments of type \u211d[x] and \u211d[x, x] will be respectively interpreted as vector and matrix. Note NabLab library provides a linear algebra extension containing some Ax=B functions to solve linear systems. Mesh extension mesh extension CartesianMesh2D; This kind of extension defines the interface of a mesh library. Its definition strictly follows the following sequence: Item types Connectivities The syntax of item types and connectivities is described below. Note NabLab library provides a mesh extension containing the signature of a 2D cartesian mesh used by NabLab examples. Imports The with keyword allows to import NabLab extensions, libraries of reductions and functions external to the module. NabLab provides two native extensions: Math and Linear Algebra (follow the link to see the available functions and reductions). To use them in your own module, just create an import section as follow: module ImplicitHeatEquation; with Math.*; with LinearAlgebra.*; Item types and connectivities Items are elements of a set, typically mesh elements. The various types of items are defined in a set. itemtypes { node, cell, face } Note Sets are surrounded by curly brackets and separated by a comma. A connectivity declaration id defined by a name, its inputs items and an output item or a set of output items. connectivity nodes: \u2192 {node}; // mesh nodes connectivity cells: \u2192 {cell}; // mesh cells connectivity faces: \u2192 {face}; // mesh faces connectivity neighborCells: cell \u2192 {cell}; // neighbor cells of a cell connectivity nodesOfFace: face \u2192 {node}; // nodes of a face connectivity nodesOfCell: cell \u2192 {node}; // nodes of a cell connectivity commonFace: cell \u00d7 cell \u2192 face; // common face of two cells NabLab provides Java and C++ mesh libraries. They implement the above connectivities. You can also use yous own library. A documentation will be available shortly. Reductions and functions Reductions Reductions are defined by their name, neutral element (seed of the reduction) and type corresponding to the type of their arguments and also their return type. They can be overloaded: it is possible to create multiple reductions with same name and different type. def \u2211, 0.0: \u211d, (a, b) \u2192 return a + b; def \u2211, 0.0: x | \u211d[x], (a, b) \u2192 return a + b; Functions Functions are defined by their name, input arguments, return type and body. They can be overloaded: it is possible to create multiple functions with same name and different input arguments. Function's body is a unique instruction or a block of instructions. It cannot refer to global variables. That is the reason why functions are declared before variables. def one: \u2192 \u2115, () \u2192 return 1; // function with no in arg def inc: \u2115 \u2192 \u2115, (a) \u2192 return a+1; // overloaded function inc on \u2115 def inc: \u211d \u2192 \u211d, (a) \u2192 return a+1.0; // overloaded function inc on \u211d def dot: x | \u211d[x] \u00d7 \u211d[x] \u2192 \u211d, (a , b) \u2192 { let \u211d result = 0.0; \u2200 i \u2208 [0;x[, result = result + a[i]*b[i]; return result; } In an extension, functions can be external, without body definition. In this case the definition of an extension provider allows to call a native function (C, C++...). This mechanism allows to use legacy libraries, like linear algebra libraries. Note External functions, i.e. functions with no body, are not allowed in modules, only in extensions. Global variables Global variables are defined by their type, name and eventually one or several supports representing the connectivity on which the variable lives. Note UTF-8 characters for variable names are supported to fit domain scientists classical notations, for example \u03b4t, \u03c1... The type of the variable is one of the 3 NabLab base types: boolean \u213e , integer \u2115 or real \u211d . It can be scalar or array. Arrays are defined by giving a comma separated list of sizes between brackets. Note NabLab text editor offers a contextual code completion and interactive ASCII template sequences to enter UTF-8 keywords. \u213e is_ok; // boolean \u2115 i, j; // integers \u211d t, \u03b4t; // reals \u211d[2] x; // 1 dimension real array \u211d[2, 2] xx; // 2 dimensions real array \u211d[2] X{nodes}; // array of 2 reals on each node \u211d[2, 2] Ajr{cells, nodesOfCell}; // 2x2 matrix on each node of each cell Multiple variables can be declared in the same instruction into a comma separated list. \u211d t, \u03b4t; \u211d c{cells}, m{cells}, p{cells}; A variable initialized with a default value is preceded by the let keyword. It is not possible to assign several variables in one definition. A user option is preceded by the option keyword. The option can be set in a Json data file. If the option has a default value it becomes optional in the data file otherwise the execution will produce an error if the option has no default value and is not found in the data file. let \u211d \u03b3 = 3.0; // real scalar let \u211d[2] N = [0.0, 1.0]; // 1 dimension real array let \u211d[2, 2] N = [ [0.0, 1.0], N ]; // 2 dimensions real array let \u2115[2,2] I = [ [1, 0], [0, 1] ]; // 2 dimensions int array option \u2115 maxIter = 200; // optional integer user option option \u211d maxTime; // mandatory real user option Time iterators The iterate section is used to define time iterators and the stop conditions of their time loop. // definition of time iterator n iterate n while (residual > \u03b5); Variables can be referenced with defined iterators. In the above example defining a n time iterator, a variable can be referenced at n=0 , n and n+1 . A variable named t can be referenced like this: t^{n=0} , t^{n} and t^{n+1} . Note For the moment, only the +1 increment of the iterator is allowed. It is possible to define several time iterators into a comma separated list: the iterator of index k+1 is then nested into the iterator of index k . // definition of time iterators n and k. iterate n while (t^{n+1} < stopTime && n+1 < maxIterations), k while (residual > \u03b5 && check(k+1 < maxIterationsK)); In case of several iterators, variables can be referenced by a list of defined time iterators, respecting the order of inclusion. In the above example defining n and k inside n, a variable can be referenced by n=0 , n , n+1 , n+1, k=0 , n+1, n , and n+1, k+1 . Variable named t can be referenced like this: t^{n=0} , t^{n} , t^{n+1} , t^{n+1, k=0} , t^{n+1, k} , t^{n+1, k+1} . It is also possible to define a block of inner iterators to define several loops included in a main time loop. iterate n while (t^{n+1} < maxTime && n+1 < maxIter), { k while (k+1 < maxIterK); l while (l+1 < maxIterL); } In the above example defining n, k inside n and l inside n, a variable can be referenced by n=0 , n , n+1 and either n+1, k=0 , n+1, n , n+1, k+1 or n+1, l=0 , n+1, l , n+1, l+1 . A variable named t can be referenced like this: t^{n=0} , t^{n} , t^{n+1} and either t^{n+1, k=0} , t^{n+1, k} , t^{n+1, k+1} or t^{n+1, l=0} , t^{n+1, l} , t^{n+1, l+1} . Note For a time iterator n , if a variable is initialized at n=0 , NabLab automatically initializes n with n=0 value of the variable at the beginning of the time loop and with n+1 value during loop iterations. Jobs Jobs are identified by a name, starting with an upper case. They are composed of an instruction, or a block of instructions. Ini: j = 0; IniTime: t^{n=0} = 0.0; ComputeDensity: \u2200j\u2208cells(), \u03c1{j} = m{j} / V{j}; The execution of a NabLab program does not start at its beginning and jobs execution order does not correspond to their position in the file. During the compilation phase, the data flow graph of the program is computed according to input and output variables of each job. Jobs are annotated with an at statement corresponding to its hierarchical logical time (HLT). The HLT concept is explicitly expressed to go beyond the classical single-program-multiple-data or bulk-synchronous-parallel programming models. The at logical timestamp explicitly declares the task-based parallelism of jobs. However, this way to schedule jobs imposes to have a dedicated tool to visualize the graph representing the program execution. This feature has been developed and integrated into the NabLab environment (see getting started documentation for details). Instructions The main instructions of the language are: local variable and set definitions, affectations, blocks, loops, conditionals. An instruction ends with the ; character except blocks surrounded by curly brackets. Local variables and set definitions Local variables can be defined with the same syntax than global ones but local definitions include neither variables with supports nor user options. Set of items can be defined locally by calling a connectivity, like this: set my_cells = cells(); Affectations An affectation is composed of a variable reference, the = character and an expression. \u03c1_ic = \u03c1IniZg; t^{n=0} = 0.0; N = [0.0, 1.0]; Cjr_ic{j,r} = 0.5 * perp(X^{n=0}{r+1} - X^{n=0}{r-1}); Blocks A block is a list of instructions. It follows the Composite Design Pattern : The block is an instruction and contains itself a list of instructions. The block is surrounded with curly brackets. { \u03c1_ic = \u03c1IniZd; p_ic = pIniZd; } Loops NabLab provides two instructions for loops: while and \u2200 . The while is composed of a condition, which is an expression, and an instruction that can be a block. while (t^{n} < 5.0) x = 0; while (residual > \u03b5) { alpha = 1.0 / det(a); I = [ [1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0] ]; } The \u2200 loop provides two kinds of iteration blocks: interval and space iterators. Interval are going from 0 to n-1 with n an integer result of an expression. \u2200i\u2208[0;5[, x = 0; \u2200i\u2208[0;x+4[, { beta = i * a; A = [i, 0]; } Space iterators allows to loop on connectivity sets. // loop on cells \u2200j\u2208cells(), \u03c1{j} = m{j} / V{j}; // loop on topNodes \u2200r\u2208topNodes(), { let \u211d[2] N = [0.0, 1.0]; let \u211d[2,2] NxN = tensProduct(N,N); let \u211d[2,2] IcP = I - NxN; bt{r} = matVectProduct(IcP, b{r}); } // loop on cells with a reduction on nodesOfCell \u2200j\u2208cells(), V{j} = 0.5 * \u2211{r\u2208nodesOfCell(j)}(dot(C{j,r}, X^{n}{r})); // loop on cells and inner loop on nodesOfCell \u2200j\u2208cells(), \u2200r\u2208nodesOfCell(j), Ajr{j,r} = ((\u03c1{j} * c{j}) / l{j,r}) * tensProduct(C{j,r}, C{j,r}); It is possible to define a loop iterator counter viewed as an integer local variable. \u2200j, ij \u2208cells(), \u03c1{j} = V{j} * ij; Conditionals Conditionals are defined with the classical if , else sequence. The condition in the if instruction is an expression, like for the while instruction. The else clause is optional. if (center[0] < xInterface) { \u03c1_ic = \u03c1IniZg; p_ic = pIniZg; } else { \u03c1_ic = \u03c1IniZd; p_ic = pIniZd; } Expressions Expressions are composed of the following elements: Unary operators minus - and not ! Binary operators add + , substract - , multiply * , divide / and modulo % Comparison operators greater than > , greater than or equal >= , less than < , less than or equal <= , equal == , not equal != Boolean operators and && and or || Contracted if operator (condition) ? true : false Min and max constants for integer and real base types: \u2115.MinValue , \u2115.MaxValue , \u211d.MinValue , \u211d.MaxValue Array initializations by comma separated list of expressions between brackets, for example [1, 2+3, -5] for \u2115[3] , [ [1.1, 1.2], [2.1, 2.2], [3.1, 3.2] ] for \u211d[3,2] Argument/variable references and reduction/function calls detailed below. Arguments and variable references Function arguments and variables are referenced by their name that can be followed by: A list of time iterators surrounded by the ^{ } and separated by a comma: t^{n+1} , t^{n+1, k} For variables with a support, a list of space iterators surrounded by the { } and separated by a comma: P{j} , Ajr{j, r} . Iterators are defined by loops and reductions. Iterators can have an increment, like X{r+1} or X{r-1} , to access the item before or after the original iterator in the set where it is defined. For arrays, a list of indices surrounded by [ ] and separated by a comma: X[0] , Y[i, 0] . Indices are expressions. Reduction and function calls A reduction call includes an iteration on a set or interval, like for a space iterator loop, and an expression of the type of the reduction. For example, to compute the sum of a real variable P defined on cells, the call includes the cells set iterator and the variable reference P{j} : let \u211d sum = \u2211{j\u2208cells()}(P{j}); A function call is defined by the name of the function and the right number and type of input arguments as expressions: let \u211d my_cos = cos(3.14 + 3.14);","title":"NabLab language reference"},{"location":"nablablanguage/#nablab-language","text":"","title":"NabLab language"},{"location":"nablablanguage/#module-and-extensions","text":"A NabLab file, extension n , defines a module or an extension .","title":"Module and extensions"},{"location":"nablablanguage/#module","text":"module Glace2d; A module represents a NabLab program and its definition strictly follows the following sequence: Imports Reductions Functions Variables and options Time iterators Jobs A module is generally associated with a NabLab application .

It must provide some additional parameters useful for code interpretation/generation: nodeCoord identifies the NabLab variable representing node coordinates. time , timeStep , iterationMax and timeMax identifies respectively the NabLab variables representing the time of the simulation, the timeStep of the simulation, the maximum number of iterations of the main time loop and the maximum time of the simulation. MainModule Glace2d glace2d { nodeCoord = X; time = t; timeStep = \u03b4t; iterationMax = maxIterations; timeMax = stopTime; } Note iterationMax and timeMax variables are mandatory for C++ code generation, optional otherwise. Note Code completion is available with CTRL-space for all module and variable references. VTK output NabLab provides a PVD file format serializer, a VTK compatible file format. The next block of the ngen file aims at configuring this serializer. It is an optional block. The periodReferenceVariable field defines the module variable used as a reference for the frequency of the outputs. Most of the time, it is the iteration number (often named n ) or the time of the simulation (often named t ). The outputVariables field defines the list of nodes and cells variables to write in the output file. The name after the as keyword is the name displayed by Paraview . VtkOutput { periodReferenceVariable = glace2d.n; outputVariables = glace2d.\u03c1 as \"Density\"; } When the VtkOutput block exists in the ngen file, two options must appear in the Json data file: outputPath and outputPeriod representing respectively the VTK output directory and the frequency period of the output. For example, for an outputPeriod of 1 and a periodReferenceVariable of n , VTK files will be written at each iteration of the simulation. Here is the VTK part of the default generated Json file (in src-gen directory): \"_outputPath_comment\":\"empty outputPath to disable output\", \"outputPath\":\"output\", \"outputPeriod\":1, Dump variables NabLab provides a mechanism to dump variable values. It uses the LevelDB library for Java and C++ . The Java LevelDB library is included in the NabLab environment. To use the C++ one, you have to download and install it on your computer. To trigger the dump of all variables (except linear algebra ones) of your code, add a LevelDB block. In addition to that, in case of C++ generation, provide the path to the LevelDB installation. LevelDB { leveldb_ROOT = \"$ENV{HOME}/leveldb/install\"; } Note The leveldb_ROOT value supports CMake syntax like $ENV{HOME} in the example above. When the LevelDB block exists in the ngen file, the nonRegression option must appear in the Json data file. If its value is CreateReference , variables are dumped in a directory named ApplicationNameDB.ref . If its value is CompareToReference , variables are dumped in a directory named Application NameDB.current and are compared to variables stored in ApplicationNameDB.ref . \"_nonRegression_comment\":\"empty value to disable, CreateReference or CompareToReference to take action\", \"nonRegression\":\"\" Configuring interpretation Interpreter needs to be configured only if you use an extension with no Java provider. See the extension section for details. Configuring generation To configure generation, create as many generation blocks as desired generation targets. Possible targets are: Java for a multi-threaded Java code, Kokkos for a Kokkos multi-threaded C++ code based on Open MP, KokkosTeamThread for a Kokkos hierarchical multi-threaded C++ code with team of threads, OpenMP for an Open MP multi-threaded C++ code, CppSequential for a sequential C++ code, StlThread for a multi-threaded C++ code based on an STL threads API provided by the NabLab library. Here is an example of a generation block: Kokkos { outputPath = \"/NabLabExamples/src-gen-cpp/kokkos\"; CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER = \"/usr/bin/g++\"; Kokkos_ROOT = \"$ENV{HOME}/kokkos/install\"; } All targets have to define the outputPath of the generation and a set of variables which will be reported in the CMakeLists.txt file. Note A good practice is to name \"src-gen\" a directory containing only generated code. For Kokkos , KokkosTeamThread , the Kokkos library has to be installed and the path to the library has to be provided is the Kokkos_ROOT variable. Moreover, if linear algebra is used, KokkosKernels_ROOT variable must be set to Kokkos Kernels installation directory. Note Variables can use CMake syntax in their value like $ENV{HOME} for path in the example above. Provider A NabLab module can import some extensions. Those extensions contain some functions. Some of them can be external functions i.e. functions with just a signature definition and no body. In this case, these external functions are defined in a native language, for example C++. To connect definitions to signatures, providers have to be defined: some glue code must be written, providers have to be declared in a ngen file. Note NabLab offers a code generator to initialize the glue code and the ngen file for extension providers. See My first extension for that. Most of the time, all providers of an extension are declared in the same ngen file. For example, for linearalgebra extension part of the NabLab library, defined in the linearalgebra.n file, a linearalgebra.ngen file contains the providers. Provider LinearAlgebraStl : LinearAlgebra { target = StlThread; compatibleTargets = CppSequential, OpenMP; outputPath = \"/.nablab/linearalgebra\"; } Provider LinearAlgebraKokkos : LinearAlgebra { target = Kokkos; compatibleTargets = KokkosTeamThread; outputPath = \"/.nablab/linearalgebra\"; } Provider LinearAlgebraJava : LinearAlgebra { target = Java; outputPath = \"/.nablab/linearalgebra\"; } A provider is defined by its name and the extension it implements (after the : character). The provider block is composed of: target defining which generation target the provider implements. compatibleTargets , an optional field, representing a list of generation targets compatible with the target previously defined. In the above LinearAlgebraKokkos example, the target indicates that the provider's source code is designed for a multi-threaded C++ Kokkos source code. The compatibleTargets indicates that a caller generated with a KokkosTeamThread target can use this provider. outputPath containing the directory of the providers's source code.","title":"Ngen language reference"},{"location":"ngenlanguage/#ngen-language","text":"A ngen file, extension ngen , defines an Application or n (or several) ExtensionProvider .

The next block of the ngen file aims at configuring this serializer. It is an optional block. The periodReferenceVariable field defines the module variable used as a reference for the frequency of the outputs. Most of the time, it is the iteration number (often named n ) or the time of the simulation (often named t ). The outputVariables field defines the list of nodes and cells variables to write in the output file. The name after the as keyword is the name displayed by Paraview . VtkOutput { periodReferenceVariable = glace2d.n; outputVariables = glace2d.\u03c1 as \"Density\"; } When the VtkOutput block exists in the ngen file, two options must appear in the Json data file: outputPath and outputPeriod representing respectively the VTK output directory and the frequency period of the output. For example, for an outputPeriod of 1 and a periodReferenceVariable of n , VTK files will be written at each iteration of the simulation.

It uses the LevelDB library for Java and C++ . The Java LevelDB library is included in the NabLab environment. To use the C++ one, you have to download and install it on your computer. To trigger the dump of all variables (except linear algebra ones) of your code, add a LevelDB block. In addition to that, in case of C++ generation, provide the path to the LevelDB installation. LevelDB { leveldb_ROOT = \"$ENV{HOME}/leveldb/install\"; } Note The leveldb_ROOT value supports CMake syntax like $ENV{HOME} in the example above. When the LevelDB block exists in the ngen file, the nonRegression option must appear in the Json data file.

Note A good practice is to name \"src-gen\" a directory containing only generated code. For Kokkos , KokkosTeamThread , the Kokkos library has to be installed and the path to the library has to be provided is the Kokkos_ROOT variable. Moreover, if linear algebra is used, KokkosKernels_ROOT variable must be set to Kokkos Kernels installation directory.

Those extensions contain some functions. Some of them can be external functions i.e. functions with just a signature definition and no body. In this case, these external functions are defined in a native language, for example C++. To connect definitions to signatures, providers have to be defined: some glue code must be written, providers have to be declared in a ngen file. Note NabLab offers a code generator to initialize the glue code and the ngen file for extension providers. See My first extension for that. Most of the time, all providers of an extension are declared in the same ngen file.
